# LoanLens-Credit-risk-Analysis
LoanLens: Credit Risk Analysis – A machine learning project that predicts loan approvals using applicant demographics, financial history, and credit data. Includes EDA, feature engineering, and classification models with actionable insights to support data-driven lending decisions.


# 📌 Project Overview

Loan approvals are critical for financial institutions, but traditional methods can be biased and inefficient. LoanLens leverages data analysis and machine learning to predict loan approval outcomes and uncover the most influential factors in decision-making.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Banks face challenges in assessing loan applicants fairly while minimizing defaults. Factors like income, credit history, and property influence approval, but the impact isn’t always clear.
LoanLens solves this by:

Cleaning and preprocessing applicant data

Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Building predictive machine learning models

Providing business insights to reduce loan risks

# 🛠️ Skills & Tools Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – Data preprocessing & visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

EDA & Feature Engineering – Handling missing values, encoding, scaling

Statistical Analysis – Hypothesis testing for data-driven validation

Business Analytics – Translating outputs into managerial insights

# 📊 Key Insights

Credit history is the strongest predictor of loan approval.

Higher income ≠ guaranteed approval; repayment capacity matters more.

Property area & education have smaller but noticeable impacts.

Logistic Regression achieved ~78% accuracy, balancing performance & interpretability.
